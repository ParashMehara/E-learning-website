            <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is one of the most popular programming languages used for developing a wide range of applications, from web and mobile apps to enterprise-level systems.</p>

            <h3>1. History of Java</h3>
            <p>Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s, with its first public release in 1996. The language was initially designed for interactive television, but it became popular for web and enterprise applications due to its portability and performance.</p>

            <h3>2. Key Features of Java</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java follows the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), which includes concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.</li>
                <li><strong>Robust and Secure:</strong> Java provides strong memory management and exception handling features, along with a secure execution environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Java supports multithreaded programming, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently within a single program.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Memory Management:</strong> Java includes garbage collection to automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Java Development Kit (JDK)</h3>
            <p>The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java Virtual Machine), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed for Java development.</p>

            <h3>4. Writing Your First Java Program</h3>
            <p>Hereâ€™s a simple example of a Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This program demonstrates the basic structure of a Java application.</p>

            <h4>Code Example: HelloWorld.java</h4>
            <pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</code></pre>

            <h3>5. Java Syntax and Structure</h3>
            <p>Java code is organized into classes and methods. The basic structure of a Java program includes a class definition with a <code>main</code> method, which serves as the entry point of the program. The syntax of Java is similar to C++, which makes it easier for programmers familiar with C-based languages to learn Java.</p>

            <h3>6. Java Development Environment</h3>
            <p>Java can be developed using a variety of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans. These IDEs provide tools and features that simplify coding, debugging, and project management.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language that offers a range of features and tools for developing various types of applications. Understanding its core concepts and features is the first step in mastering Java programming.</p>
