            <h2>Basic Syntax and Data Types</h2>
            <p>Understanding the basic syntax and data types in Java is essential for writing effective Java programs. This section covers the fundamental aspects of Java syntax, data types, and how to use them in your code.</p>

            <h3>1. Java Syntax</h3>
            <p>Java syntax refers to the set of rules that define how Java programs are written and interpreted. It includes the structure of code, keywords, and conventions used in Java programming. Here are some key elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statements:</strong> Java programs are composed of statements, which are instructions executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Each statement ends with a semicolon (<code>;</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Blocks:</strong> A block of code is enclosed within curly braces (<code>{}</code>) and can contain one or more statements. Blocks are used to group statements together.</li>
                <li><strong>Indentation:</strong> While indentation is not required for the program to run, it is crucial for readability. Consistent indentation helps make the code easier to understand.</li>
                <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Comments are used to document the code and are ignored by the compiler. There are single-line comments (<code>//</code>) and multi-line comments (<code>/* ... */</code>).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Data Types</h3>
            <p>Java supports various data types that define the type of data a variable can hold. Java data types are categorized into two main types: primitive data types and reference data types.</p>

            <h4>Primitive Data Types</h4>
            <p>Primitive data types are the most basic data types in Java. They are built into the language and represent simple values. Java has eight primitive data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>byte:</strong> 8-bit signed integer with a range of -128 to 127.</li>
                <li><strong>short:</strong> 16-bit signed integer with a range of -32,768 to 32,767.</li>
                <li><strong>int:</strong> 32-bit signed integer with a range of -2^31 to 2^31-1.</li>
                <li><strong>long:</strong> 64-bit signed integer with a range of -2^63 to 2^63-1.</li>
                <li><strong>float:</strong> 32-bit floating-point number used for decimal values.</li>
                <li><strong>double:</strong> 64-bit floating-point number used for more precise decimal values.</li>
                <li><strong>char:</strong> 16-bit Unicode character representing a single character.</li>
                <li><strong>boolean:</strong> Represents a value that can be either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Reference Data Types</h4>
            <p>Reference data types refer to objects and are used to store references to those objects. Unlike primitive types, they do not hold actual values but rather point to memory locations where the objects are stored. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>String:</strong> Represents a sequence of characters and is used for storing text.</li>
                <li><strong>Arrays:</strong> Represents a collection of elements of the same type.</li>
                <li><strong>Objects:</strong> Instances of user-defined classes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables are containers for storing data values. In Java, you must declare a variable before using it. The declaration includes the data type and the variable name. Here's an example:</p>
            <pre><code>int age;
age = 25;
double height = 5.9;
char grade = 'A';
boolean isStudent = true;
</code></pre>

            <h3>4. Type Conversion</h3>
            <p>Type conversion refers to converting one data type to another. In Java, type conversion can be categorized into two types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Implicit Conversion:</strong> Automatic conversion performed by the JVM when assigning a value of a smaller data type to a larger data type (e.g., <code>int</code> to <code>double</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Explicit Conversion:</strong> Manual conversion performed by the programmer using type casting (e.g., converting a <code>double</code> to an <code>int</code>).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Constants</h3>
            <p>Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed once they are initialized. In Java, constants are declared using the <code>final</code> keyword. Here's an example:</p>
            <pre><code>final int MAX_AGE = 100;
</code></pre>

            <h3>6. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Understanding the basic syntax and data types in Java is fundamental to writing efficient and effective Java programs. Mastering these concepts will provide a strong foundation for exploring more advanced topics in Java programming.</p>
