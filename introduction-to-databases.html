            <h2>What is a Database?</h2>
            <p>A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Databases can store information about people, products, orders, or anything else that might be relevant to an organization.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Types of Databases</h2>
            <p>There are several types of databases, each serving different purposes and providing different functionalities. The most common types include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relational Databases:</strong> These databases store data in tables with rows and columns. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.</li>
                <li><strong>NoSQL Databases:</strong> These databases are designed for unstructured data. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Databases:</strong> These databases store data in the form of objects, similar to object-oriented programming. Examples include db4o and ObjectDB.</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchical Databases:</strong> These databases organize data in a tree-like structure. An example is IBM's Information Management System (IMS).</li>
                <li><strong>Network Databases:</strong> These databases use a graph structure to represent and store data. An example is the Integrated Data Store (IDS).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Database Management Systems (DBMS)</h2>
            <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that interacts with the user, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. The DBMS provides a way to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data in the database.</p>
            <p>Popular DBMSs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> An open-source relational database management system.</li>
                <li><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> An advanced, open-source relational database system.</li>
                <li><strong>Oracle Database:</strong> A multi-model database management system produced by Oracle Corporation.</li>
                <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.</li>
                <li><strong>Microsoft SQL Server:</strong> A relational database management system developed by Microsoft.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Importance of Databases</h2>
            <p>Databases play a critical role in the storage, retrieval, and management of data. They help ensure data consistency, integrity, and security while supporting concurrent access and complex queries.</p>
            <p>In today's data-driven world, databases are essential for businesses and organizations to store and manage their data effectively, enabling informed decision-making and efficient operations.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Understanding the basics of databases and their management systems is fundamental for anyone involved in data handling, software development, or IT operations. This introduction provides a foundation for exploring more advanced topics in database management and administration.</p>
