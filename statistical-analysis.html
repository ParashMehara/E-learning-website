            <h2>Introduction to Statistical Analysis</h2>
            <p>Statistical analysis involves applying statistical methods to collect, analyze, interpret, and present data. It helps in making informed decisions and predictions based on data. Statistical analysis is used to summarize data, identify trends, test hypotheses, and estimate parameters.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Types of Statistical Analysis</h2>
            <p>Statistical analysis can be broadly categorized into two types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong> Involves summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. Common measures include mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.</li>
                <li><strong>Inferential Statistics:</strong> Involves making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample. Techniques include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Descriptive Statistics</h2>
            <p>Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the dataset and include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Measures of Central Tendency:</strong> Mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value).</li>
                <li><strong>Measures of Dispersion:</strong> Range (difference between the maximum and minimum values), variance (measure of the spread of values), and standard deviation (square root of variance).</li>
                <li><strong>Measures of Shape:</strong> Skewness (asymmetry of the distribution) and kurtosis (peakedness of the distribution).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Inferential Statistics</h2>
            <p>Inferential statistics involve making predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample. Key concepts include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hypothesis Testing:</strong> A method to test assumptions about a population using sample data. Common tests include t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.</li>
                <li><strong>Confidence Intervals:</strong> A range of values, derived from the sample data, that is likely to contain the population parameter with a specified level of confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Regression Analysis:</strong> A technique used to model and analyze the relationships between variables. Includes linear regression, multiple regression, and logistic regression.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Statistical Analysis Tools</h2>
            <p>Several tools and software are available for performing statistical analysis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python Libraries:</strong> Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, StatsModels</li>
                <li><strong>R Libraries:</strong> dplyr, ggplot2, stats</li>
                <li><strong>Statistical Software:</strong> SPSS, SAS, Stata</li>
                <li><strong>Spreadsheet Software:</strong> Excel, Google Sheets</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Statistical analysis is a fundamental aspect of data science that enables the extraction of meaningful insights from data. By understanding and applying various statistical methods, data scientists can make informed decisions, test hypotheses, and uncover trends and patterns in the data.</p>
