            <h2>What is a Relational Database?</h2>
            <p>A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables, which are organized into rows and columns. Each table represents a different entity, and relationships between tables are established using keys. This model is based on the relational model proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tables:</strong> The fundamental building blocks of a relational database. Each table represents an entity and contains rows (records) and columns (fields).</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Key:</strong> A unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified.</li>
                <li><strong>Foreign Key:</strong> A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row in another table. It is used to establish relationships between tables.</li>
                <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Associations between tables in a database. Common types of relationships include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.</li>
                <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Normalization involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables.</li>
                <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Structured Query Language, the standard language for querying and manipulating relational databases.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>SQL Basics</h2>
            <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data. Some basic SQL commands include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SELECT:</strong> Retrieves data from a database.</li>
                <li><strong>INSERT:</strong> Adds new data to a table.</li>
                <li><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Modifies existing data in a table.</li>
                <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Removes data from a table.</li>
                <li><strong>CREATE TABLE:</strong> Creates a new table in the database.</li>
                <li><strong>ALTER TABLE:</strong> Modifies an existing table.</li>
                <li><strong>DROP TABLE:</strong> Deletes a table from the database.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Advantages of Relational Databases</h2>
            <p>Relational databases offer several advantages, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Ensures data accuracy and consistency through constraints and normalization.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Allows for complex queries and relationships between data.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Supports large amounts of data and high transaction volumes.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Provides robust security features to protect data.</li>
                <li><strong>ACID Properties:</strong> Ensures reliable transactions through Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Common Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)</h2>
            <p>Some popular RDBMSs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> An open-source RDBMS widely used in web applications.</li>
                <li><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> An advanced, open-source RDBMS known for its robustness and standards compliance.</li>
                <li><strong>Oracle Database:</strong> A multi-model database management system known for its reliability and scalability.</li>
                <li><strong>Microsoft SQL Server:</strong> A relational database management system developed by Microsoft.</li>
                <li><strong>SQLite:</strong> A self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, and transactional SQL database engine.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Understanding relational database concepts is essential for managing and organizing data effectively. Relational databases provide a powerful and flexible way to store and retrieve data, making them a cornerstone of modern data management systems.</p>
